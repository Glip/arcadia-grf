Are you sure you want to cancel navigation?#
Navigation help:#
You can use the search box to search for Maps, NPCs and Monsters.#
The search is case-sensitive and in include-all mode. This means:#
  - The search query "Kaf of Prontera" will display all of Prontera Kafra Employees.#
  - The search query "luna" will NOT find Lunatics.  "Luna" or "nati" will.#
You can use some special keywords, such as:#
  - "$$lv30": Search for all monsters of level 30. (you can use ranges, such as "$$lv20~30")#
  - "$$all": Output all items in the navigation database.  Please note that this will output a really long list.#
When you select an item from the search results, its details are displayed.#
When you start the navigation mode, each step of your route will be displayed.#
You can toggle between search mode and your current navigation by pressing the button below the list.#
You can change the the navigation settings to prevent it from including NPC warp services, dungeon scrolls or airship travels in the calculated route.#
----------- Navigation Commands -------------#
/navigation <map> <x> <y> (short: /navi)#
  Example: /navi prontera 100 100 -> Route to prontera (100,100)#
/navigation2 <map> <x> <y> <scroll> <npc> <airship> (short: /navi2)#
  Example: /navi2 prontera 100 90 0 1 1 : Route to prontera (100,100) allowing NPC and Airship routes but disallowing dungeon scrolls usage.#
You can use these commands in the chatbox to quickly access route to a specific destination, without bringing up the Navigation UI.#
Note: Coordinates (<x> and <y>) in the above commands must be up to 3 digits long.#
Please note that the navigation commands are experimental and currently not fully working.#
They'll be enabled (or better documented) in a future update.  We apologize for the inconvenience.#

A scholar is in dire need of assistance as he struggles to find any documents or texts regarding the eras in which King Grenholm von Gaebolg and its predecessor, King von Schmitz Walter, ruled Rune Midgard.                                                     As adventurers aid in the search, they find themselves meeting the wise sage Mimir, who apparently has the ability to create rifts through time.                                                                            To discover the truth behind lost history, you'll find yourself traveling to the older days of Rune Midgard and experiencing the past firsthand as you play a critical role in investigating who's behind the assassination attempts on the king and try to find how to prevent the culprits from succeeding.#
