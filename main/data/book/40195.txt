^FFFFFF~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Servant's Lament~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In halls where shadows dance 'neath moonlit skies,
A humble servant's love he dare not prize.
For Lady fair, whose heart he yearns to win,
A secret blooms, though bound by fate's cruel spin.

Within the traveler's rest where dreams reside,
A humble box shall keep what hearts confide.
The key, concealed, awaits the seeker's hand,
To bridge the fate that love and loss demand.

Though Geffen's streets may twist and lure astray,
The inn shall guide where weary hearts might stay.
For love denied may yet ignite a spark,
And hidden keys may guide through shadows dark.
