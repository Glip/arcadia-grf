How long have I been here? It feels like days now.
Every room looks the same.
The same doors. The same walls. The same floors.
I try to leave, but I just end up in the same place.

I thought I'd found solace that there was a clock here.
But just my luck, it's broken...
I watch it and watch it and watch it.
Seconds, minutes, and hours go by. I can see the hands moving. Over and over. 
But no matter when I look, it's always 5:30.

That infernal ticking is driving me crazy...stop it...stop it... please, stop it...
