Hello and welcome. Take a look around.
Hopefully by now you aren't too beat down.


My friends, you will see, are scattered nearby,
But something is missing, something's gone awry.


Do not be afraid, there's no cause for alarm,
Though you may have your doubts they will cause you no harm.


Their heads are now bare, their forms incomplete.
Pair statue and crown and you're in for a treat.





With two of a kind nearby you'll be met.
The righteous deserves, yet the sinister gets.


The horned pair are locked in an eternal battle.
With back against wall, one yields to the cattle.


Their mountain cousin, its aquatic tail swayed,
looks away from the fight to gaze at the maid.


Shunned by the maiden, reflecting on past mistakes,
staring in silence, the archer's heart aches.


Scared by the ruckus, the scorpion flees,
to nest in a corner where no-one can see.

Meanwhile 'round the fountain a group of them gather
The aquatic trio chat and merrily blather


At the top stands one with the air of an impostor,
To its friends sharing water, it complements the roster


But as close as they are, they're cautious of the crab,
and stand near the wall so its pincers can't grab.


The king of the jungle, instincts still intact,
stands facing the center, ready to attack.


Perfectly in balance the last can be found.
If you're wanting a clue, you should look at the ground.
