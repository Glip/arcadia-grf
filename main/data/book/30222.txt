I've been trying to stay calm. I really am. I'm thankful for the water I brought, 
but I'm getting so hungry. 

After the noises we heard the first night, I'm just too scared to leave the room
and the door is staying locked until I know somebody is here to rescue me. 

Dad always said candles would come in handy for adventuring. 

Please come soon...Good night.
