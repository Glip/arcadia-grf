I have been waiting for awhile now. Where could my brother have gone off to? 

All we were doing was trying to have some fun exploring this place.
 
I know he probably went for help, but really... what else can I do? Waiting is the safest bet
for now, I am sure of it.

I miss you, brother. 

Please come soon! If only I could find my glasses. 

I can barely squint enough to write...
