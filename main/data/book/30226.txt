There was something outside the door last night. I'm certain of it. 

The whispers turned to voices; the voices turned to screams;
the screams turned into violent thrashes against the door.
The ringing became unbearable, and in an instant,
everything went silent. 

You don't know what it's like to survive off eating bugs, broken bits of candle wax, 
and your own...hair. 

I've forgotten what it's like to cry.
