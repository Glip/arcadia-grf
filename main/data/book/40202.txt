^48466fMy respected Fellow Midgardian,

Now that I can freely approach you, I trust this disguised missive finds you well.
I, Lord Sebastián Vectorian, humbly seek your assistance in a matter of great 
personal significance.

The radiant Lady Veluvia Barrington, a woman of unmatched beauty and formidable wit, 
has long held my admiration. Yet, her guarded heart has proven impervious to my affections.
With Valentine's Day approaching, I am resolved to present her with a gift both thoughtful
and exquisite, one that might soften her reserve and convey the depths of my regard.

I turn to you, as a trusted confidant, renowned for ingenuity and discretion, to aid me 
in this endeavor. Together, we shall craft a gesture so perfect it may win her favor.
Look around for a helper of mine and meet me at the Barrington Mansion after. 
I shall reveal the details of this delicate task there.
Your efforts shall not go unrewarded, and you will have my enduring gratitude.

Yours faithfully,
Lord Sebastián Vectorian^000000
