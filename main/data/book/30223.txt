I don't want to say it but...I don't think I'm getting out of here. I'm so scared...

I'm beginning to wonder if anybody is even coming for me... 

I heard a noise earlier, but I'm not sure what it was. It was faint. It sounded like...
a muffled scream... on the other side of the house. 

It's so quiet that you could hear the leaves falling. 
There is no love in this place. And I don't think I'm alone.
